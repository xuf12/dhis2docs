  <title>Settings</title>
  <para>The settings module provides a set of application configuration options. There are two main
    groups of settings: the <emphasis role="italic">system settings</emphasis> apply to the whole
    system and all its users while the <emphasis role="italic">user settings</emphasis> apply to the
    environment of the currently logged in user. The system settings can be accessed from the
    maintenance menu, settings module. The user settings can be accessed under the profile menu,
    settings page.</para>

    <title>System settings</title>
    <para>The system settings section provides general configuration options and options specifically for appearance and email.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Cache strategy: Decides for how long reports and responses related to analysis
            should be cached. If you are using the scheduled, nightly data mart tasks it makes sense
            to put this on &quot;Cache until 6 AM tomorrow&quot;. This is because we know that data in reports
            change at that time, and you can safely cache data up to the moment when the data mart
            is updated. If you are loading data continuously into the datamart you should set it to
            &quot;No cache&quot;. If you load data very infrequently into data mart you should consider
            setting it to &quot;Cache for two weeks&quot;.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Maximum number of analytics records: This number can be increased to provide more records from the analytics. The default is 50,000 and can be increased. </para>
          <warning>
            <para>You should be exceedingly careful when increasing the maximum number of analytics records, for instance to &quot;Unlimited&quot;. This could result in severe server instability, due to clients requesting large amounts of data from the system. </para>
          </warning>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Number of database server CPUs: The number of CPU cores of your database server can be configured as a system setting. This allows the system to perform optimally when the database is hosted on a different server than the application server, as the analytics engine scales linearly on the number of available cores. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Infrastructural data elements: This setting defines a data element group where the member data elements should describe data about the infrastructure of organisation units. Examples of such infrastructural data elements could be population, doctors, beds, Internet connectivity and climate. This infrastructural data can currently be viewed in the GIS module in the facility information sheet.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Infrastructural period type: Sets the frequency for which the data elements in the
            infrastructural data elements group are captured. This will typically be yearly. When
            viewing the infrastructural data you will be able to select the time period of the data
            source.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Feedback recipients: This setting defines a user group where the members will
            receive all messages being sent through the function for writing feedback in the
            dashboard module. This will typically be members of the super user team who are able to
            support and answer questions coming from end-users.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Maximum offline organisation unit levels: This setting defines how many levels in
            the organisation unit hierarchy will be available offline in the organisation unit tree
            widget. Under normal circumstances you can leaves this on the lowest level, which is
            default behavior. Setting it to a higher level might be useful in order to reduce
            initial load time in cases where you have a large number of organisation units, typically
            more than 30 000.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>System notifications email address: An email address can be specified to receive system notifications. Notifications about failures in processes such as analytics table generation will be sent here. This is useful for application monitoring.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Data analysis std dev factor: Sets the number of standard deviations for use in the outlier analysis performed on the captured data in the data entry module. The default value is 2; a high value will catch less outlier values than a low value.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Days after period end to qualify for timely data submission: Sets the number of days after the end of a period in which a data entry form must be marked as complete in order to be considered timely. This affects the &quot;reporting rate&quot; tool in the reporting module which lists forms marked as complete as well as marked as complete in time. The default value is 15.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Phone number area code: The area code for the area in which your deployment is located. Used for sending and receiving
            SMS.Typically, this would be a country code, for instance , +260 , which is the country code for Zambia. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Help page link: A URL can be provided for an alternative help source. This defines the URL which users will see when selecting Profile-&gt;Help.  </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) Key: Set your Google UA key here to provide analytics for your DHIS 2 instance. Most
            places are covered, but it will not be provided for custom apps. Read more about Google Analytics at <ulink url="http://google.com/analytics">http://google.com/analytics</ulink>
              .</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Enable multi-organisation unit forms: Enable support for entering data forms for
            multiple organisation units at the same time, in data entry, click on the parent
            organisation unit for the children that you want to enter data for, and the dataset list
            will include datasets that are assigned to the children of that parent.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Omit indicator values with zero numerator value in data mart: Defines whether
            aggregated indicator values with zero as the numerator value should be written to the
            indicator data mart table. Having such values written is required for instance when
            connecting Excel pivot tables to the data mart as Excel will need the numerator data to
            correctly aggregate up in the organisation unit hierarchy. If third-party tools like
            Excel are not used with the application this will reduce the total number of values
            written to the data mart (which again will improve performance) and could safely be set
            to omit.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Put analytics in maintenance mode: Puts the analytics engine / Web API resource in
            maintenance mode, implying that 503 Service Unavailable will be returned for all
            requests. This is useful when you need to perform maintenance on the server like
            rebuilding indexes while the server is running in production, in order to reduce load
            and more efficiently carry out the maintenance.</para>
