    <title>Data elements</title>
    <para><?inline true?>Data elements form the basis of DHIS2. Data elements define what is actually recorded in system, e.g. number of immunisations or number of cases of malaria. The actual creation and definition of the data elements themselves are far beyond the scope of this manual to describe, but it is assumed that an administrator will be provided with a list of standardised data elements for inclusion into the DHIS2 system. </para>
    <para>To access the data element maintenance module, choose Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and Indicators -&gt; Data element. </para>
    <para>The &apos;Filter by name&apos; will allow you to filter a range of data elements if you know either the full name of the data element, or just a part of it. Type the name
               into the search field and any matching data elements are displayed below.

 The &apos;Sort&apos; button can be used to sort the data elements into alphabetical order. </para>

  <section id="dataElementCategory">
    <title>Categories</title>
    <para>Categories can be used to disaggregate data elements into individual atomic components. They can also be used to assign attributes to all data recorded in a specific dataset, such as &quot;Implementing partner&quot; and &quot;Funding agency.&quot; </para>
    <para> Data element categories are typically a concept, such as Gender, Age or  Disease Status. Data elements such as &quot;Number of cases of confirmed malaria&quot; are often broken into smaller component parts to determine, for instance, the number of confirmed malaria cases of particular age groups. As an example, three data element categories: Under 1, 1-5 and Over 5 could be created. They could be assigned as categories to the data element, which would then create in the data entry screens, three separate fields for this data element namely: </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Number of confirmed malaria cases (Under 1)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Number of confirmed malaria cases (1-5)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Number of confirmed malaria cases (Over 5)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Effective use of data element categories greatly simplifies the process of setting up the DHIS2 system, as the data element categories can be reused to disaggregate many different data elements. Otherwise, each of the data elements listed above, would need to be created separately. Judicious use of data element categories will greatly simplify the DHIS2 implementation, and allow for subsequent advanced analysis. </para>
    <para>Where possible, category options should be recycled. For instance, there might be two categories which might share a particular category option (e.g. &lt;1 year of age). When creating the  categories, this category option could be reused. This is important if particular category options (or category option combinations) need to be analyzed together. </para>

Once all data element categories options have been added to the data element category, press the <guibutton>&quot;Add&quot;</guibutton> button to save all changes or the <guibutton>&quot;Cancel&quot;</guibutton>  button to discard any changes.</para>
    <para>A  category can have two types &quot;Disaggregation&quot; or &quot;Attribute&quot;. For disaggregation of data elements, you should select &quot;Disaggregation&quot;.  A dimension type of &quot;Attribute&quot; will allow the category to be used to assign a combination of categories to data recorded through a dataset.</para>
    <para>If the &quot;Use as data dimension&quot; box is ticked, the category will be available to the analytics as another dimension, in addition to the standard dimensions of &quot;Period&quot; and &quot;Organisation unit&quot;. </para>

  <section id="dataElementCategoryCombo">
    <title>Category combinations</title>
    <para>Category combinations allow multiple categories to be combined into a related set. As an example, a data element &quot;Number of new HIV infections&quot; might be disaggregated according to the following categories. </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Age: &quot;Under 5&quot;, &quot;5-15&quot;, &quot;15-24&quot;, &quot;24 and above&quot;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Gender: Male, Female</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para> In this example, there would be two levels of disaggregation, consisting of two separate data element categories, each consisting of several data element category options. In most HMIS systems, different data elements are disaggregated according to a common set of categories. By combining these different categories into a category combination and assigning these combinations to data elements, the appropriate disaggregation levels can be applied efficiently and quickly to a large number of data elements. </para>
    <para>To access the  category combination maintenance module, select &quot;Maintenance-&gt;Data element and indicators-&gt;Data element category combinations&quot; from the main DHIS2 menu. As with the  other maintains modules, you can filter the listed category combinations by entering the name (or portion thereof) of the category combination. Other operations such as &quot;Edit&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot; and &quot;Information&quot; should be familiar to the reader. </para>
    <para>To add a new category combination, click the &quot;Add new&quot; button. The following dialogue will be displayed. </para>

    </screenshot>
    <para>Type the name of the category combination in the &quot;Name&quot; field, and then select the desired categories from the left panel. Press the &quot;Move right&quot; button to add the selected categories to the category combination. Press &quot;Move left&quot; to remove any categories that should not be part of the category combination. </para>
    <para>Categories can only be added to a category combination at this step. Categories can be removed from category combinations later by editing the category combination, however, it is not allowed to add additional categories once the combination has been created. Ensure that the category combination and its respective categories is final before you create the category combination and assign it to a data element. </para>

    <title>Using category combinations as attributes</title>
    <para>In some deployments of DHIS2, information on attributes such as &quot;Implementing partner&quot; and &quot;Project&quot; are important to record as an attribute of each data value. To provide an example, let us suppose that an NGO is providing ART services in a given facility. They would need to report each month on the &quot;ART monthly summary&quot;, which would be reported monthly and contain a number of data elements.  The NGO and project could potentially change over time. In order to be able to effectively attribute data to a given NGO and project at any point in time, this information would need to be recorded along with each data value at the time of data entry. </para>
    <para>When categories and category combinations have a type of &quot;Attribute&quot;, they can serve as a means of applying a common set of attributes (e.g. Implementing partner and project) to a related set of data values contained in a dataset. Let us suppose we create two categories called &quot;Implementing partner&quot; and &quot;Projects&quot;. Each of these categories would be created with a dimension type of &quot;Attribute.&quot;   Finally, a category combination called &quot;Implementing partners and projects&quot; would be created with these two categories and assigned a dimension type of &quot;Attribute&quot;. Finally, we can use this dimension to apply an attribute to the dataset &quot;ART monthly summary&quot;, by choosing  the &quot;Implementing partners and projects&quot; as the &quot;Combination of categories&quot;. </para>
    <para>The following screen shot of an example data entry screen illustrates all of these concepts. </para>
    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata width="80%" align="center" fileref="resources/images/maintainence/categories_dataset_attributes.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
    <para>Note that when data is entered, an &quot;Implementing partner&quot; and &quot;Project&quot; can be selected. Each data value recorded in this data entry screen, would be assigned a specific combination of these categories as an attribute. These attributes (when specified as a dimension) can be used in the analysis modules similar to other dimensions, such as the period and orgunit.  In summary, when category combinations are used as attribute, they effectively serve as another dimension (similar to &quot;Period&quot; and &quot;Organisationion unit&quot;) which can be used for analysis. </para>

    <title>Category option combination maintenance</title>
    <para>Category option combinations can be assigned a code, which allows for easier data exchange between DHIS2 and external systems. Simply select the category option combination from the list, and provide the code. Note that all codes of category option combinations must be unique. </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Category option groups and group sets</title>
    <para>Category options can be groups and classified using category option groups. Category
        option groups can be created from &quot;Category option group&quot; &gt; &quot;Add new&quot;, and contains a set of
        category options.</para>
    <para>Category option groups can be included in category option group sets. Category option
        group sets can be created from &quot;Category option group set&quot; &gt; &quot;Add new&quot;, and contains a set
        of category option groups.</para>
    <para>The main purpose of the these entities is to be able to add more dimensionality to your
        captured data for analysis in apps such as pivot table and data visualizer. An example of
        where this becomes useful: In a system, data is collected by &quot;projects&quot;, where projects is
        modeled as category options. The system is required to do data analysis according to which
        donor supports the project. In this case, a category option group set called &quot;Donor&quot; can be
        created. Each donor can be created as a category option group, where each category option /
        project is put in the appropriate group. In data analysis apps, the &quot;Donor&quot; group set will
        appear as a data dimension, while each donor appear as dimension items, ready for inclusion
        in reports.</para>
