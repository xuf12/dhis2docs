  <title>Name-Based Information Tracking Module</title>
  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section>
      <title>Quick Background</title>
      <para>Conventionally, Public Health Systems have been recording and reporting aggregated data of the services provided across various health programmes. Though this is crucial in monitoring &quot;<emphasis role="italic">reach</emphasis>&quot; and &quot;<emphasis role="italic">availability</emphasis>&quot; of public health services, but it lacks tracing the persons being provided these services and quality of these ones. </para>
      <para>For example, the aggregate report will show that 300 pregnant women registered  for ANC and 120 women given IFA tablets or 90 women given TT injection. In an aggregate system, it is not possible to ascertain that if a particular pregnant woman registered for ANC, has also been given IFA and TT, as data only shows aggregate numbers. To understand the quality of services given to each pregnant woman registered for ANC, immunization cycle of each child or treatment of each leprosy person, etc. it is important that treatment information of each person is maintained as an individual case.</para>
      <para>The DHIS name-based information tracking module ( also known as  DHIS Community Module  ) is an integrated module in DHIS2, built to support community health systems and facilitate a smooth integration between the community health data and aggregated data management.</para>
      <para>The module supports management of community health programs, such as child immunization, maternal health and e.g. allows tracking of individuals enrolled in various programs and activity planning for community health workers.</para>

        <title>Name based information tracking process</title>
        <para>The process  starts with the person registration. Then she/he can be enrolled in the program for which registered. The application will guide the health provider  the services required for her/him through activity plan and the services  from time to time can be updated into his/her profile.  The working process is described in steps depicted in picture below - </para>

        <title>Person registration</title>
        <para>The process of  creating a new person in the system is through the registration process. The person is first registered in the system (or checked if the person already exists in system). Searching a person can be done through name, identifiers,  location or user-defined person&apos;s attributes (address, phone number, e.g.). If the person already exists in the system, the program enrollment process can continue. If the person is not available,  new registration takes place. </para>
        <para>The system supports for creating identifier type for the registration, such as Passport number, PAN, driving license, health identifier, UID. However, a system unique identifier is created automatically after registration and used to track the person.</para>
        <para>For identification a person, the health worker is first identified through any of the identifiers or name of patient  in the system and the person is identified through identifiers for receiving a health service. After identification, the individual case history can be viewed or a treatment case can be updated for  the new visit that they have received.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Program Enrollment and Activity Plan</title>
        <para>When a person is enrolled into any health programme, the person is  provided various services through the treatment are recorded. Based on the services of the program by the time, the system creates an activity plan for person.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Treatment case</title>
        <para>Each interaction with the person related to the case is considered to be an treatment case and these cases are recorded into the individual case. Individual case is updated with the identification of both the health worker and the person who is receiving the service.</para>

    <para>The module has two basic modules as follows - </para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Maintenance  module</para>

    <section>
      <title>Functionalities</title>
      <para>There are two additions in the module in both maintenance and services module. <emphasis role="italic">Maintenance</emphasis> module has one additional sub module for defining meta data and  <emphasis role="italic">Services</emphasis> module  has one additional sub-module for name-based data entry and reports.</para>
      <para>The modules provide three main functionalities -</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Definition  meta data, include person attributes, person attribute groups, identifier types, relationships, program and program-stages, validation for program and formula to generate aggregate data value.</para>

      </orderedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Person registration</title>
      <para>The first step in the tracking is the registration of person/case in the application. In the registration process, the details - which are related to the personal information, identification, contract and location details &amp; health provider details, are entered in the application. In the registration itself, person is provided with the unique identification number. This number will be unique and will not match with the identification number of any person in the state jurisdiction. The issue of identification number will be the responsibility of facility where person is registered first time.</para>
      <warning>
        <para>No matter what program persons need  to enroll, they must register into the system first. Then health providers will enroll the persons into relevant  programs. E.g. every pregnant women and the child need to be registered first as a person, then they will be enrolled in Mother Care program or Child Health program.</para>

Checking process bases on full name, gender and birthday of the registering person to look for the available persons with the similar information in the database. The result list will be displayed if the system finds out the same persons.

        <para>The function <emphasis role="italic">Define Program Validation</emphasis> is designed for defining validations of a program in which you would like to modify after entering patient data values for program stages.

For instance, Parity, Previous live birth male, Previous live birth female, Previous still birth are patient data elements. They belong to many stages. And if data value of Parity is 0, then ( Previous live birth female + Previous still birth ) = 0. Besides, if a patient data element exists into many program stages, the system will check whether the values of the patient data element are in all program stages of the program or not.

For instance, TT1 is a patient data element. It exists into program stages as follows Checkup 1, Checkup 2, Checkup 3. If the data value of this data element into Checkup 1 is null, the data values into Checkup 2, Checkup 3 should be null.</para>
