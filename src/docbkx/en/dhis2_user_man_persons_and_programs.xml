  <title>DHIS TRACKER</title>
  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section>
      <title>Quick Background</title>
      <para>Conventionally, Public Health Systems have been recording and reporting aggregated data of the services provided across various health programmes. Though this is crucial in monitoring &quot;<emphasis role="italic">reach</emphasis>&quot; and &quot;<emphasis role="italic">availability</emphasis>&quot; of public health services, but it lacks tracing the persons being provided these services and quality of these ones. </para>
      <para>For example, the aggregate report will show that 300 pregnant women registered  for ANC and 120 women given IFA tablets or 90 women given TT injection. In an aggregate system, it is not possible to ascertain that if a particular pregnant woman registered for ANC, has also been given IFA and TT, as data only shows aggregate numbers. To understand the quality of services given to each pregnant woman registered for ANC, immunization cycle of each child or treatment of each leprosy person, etc. it is important that treatment information of each person is maintained as an individual case.</para>
      <para>The DHIS tracker module ( also known as  DHIS Community Module  ) is an integrated module in DHIS2, built to support community health systems and facilitate a smooth integration between the community health data and aggregated data management.</para>
      <para>The module supports management of community health programs, such as child immunization, maternal health and e.g. allows tracking of individuals enrolled in various programs and activity planning for community health workers.</para>

      <title>Getting started with DHIS Tracker</title>
      <para>The module supports health providers for registering treatment cases and tracks these cases over time through different forms that are filled for the treatment of each person.</para>
      <para>The process  starts with the person registration. Then she/he can be enrolled in the program for which registered. The application will guide the health provider  the services required for her/him through activity plan and the services  from time to time can be updated into his/her profile.  The working process is described in steps depicted in picture below - </para>

      </screenshot>
      <note>
        <para>For programs without registration (e.g. In-Patient Morbidity and Mortality program), users only need to input treatment case and then export reports.</para>
      </note>
      <section>
        <title>Person registration</title>
        <para>The process of  creating a new person in the system is through the registration process. The person is first registered in the system (or checked if the person already exists in system). Searching a person can be done through name, identifiers,  location or user-defined person&apos;s attributes (address, child contact name, e.g.). If the person already exists in the system, the program enrollment process can continue. If the person is not available,  new registration takes place. </para>
        <para>The system supports for creating identifier type for the registration, such as Passport number, PAN, driving license, health identifier, UID. However, a system unique identifier is created automatically after registration and used to track the person.</para>
        <para>For identification a person, the health worker is first identified through any of the identifiers or name of patient  in the system and the person is identified through identifiers for receiving a health service. After identification, the individual case history can be viewed or a treatment case can be updated for  the new visit that they have received.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Program enrollment</title>
        <para>When a person is enrolled into any health programme, he/she is be provided identifier number (e.g PARA, parish, ... ) and declare some attributes which belong to the program. After, the person is  provided various services through the treatment are recorded. Based on the services of the program by the time, the system creates an activity plan for person.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Treatment case</title>
        <para>Each interaction with the person related to the case is considered to be an treatment case and these cases are recorded into the individual case. Individual case is updated with the identification of both the health worker and the person who is receiving the service.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Reports</title>
        <para>The module provides two functions for viewing the  reports to get an overview of the services provided for a program or a program stage.</para>
