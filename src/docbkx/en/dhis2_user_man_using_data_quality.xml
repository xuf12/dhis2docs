  <title>Using Data Quality functionality</title>
  <para>The data quality module provides means to improve the accuracy and reliability of the data in the system. This can be done through validation rules and various statistical checks. All the functionality described below can be accessed from the left side menu in the Services-&gt;Data Quality module.</para>
  <section>
    <title>Overview of data quality checks</title>
    <para>Ensuring data quality is a key concern in building an effective HMIS. Data quality has different dimensions including:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Correctness:</emphasis> Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that facility. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Completeness:</emphasis> Data for all data elements for all health facilities should have been submitted.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Consistency:</emphasis> Data should be consistent with data entered during earlier months and years while allowing for changes with reorganization, increased work load, etc. and consistent with other similar facilities.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Timeliness:</emphasis> All data from all reporting orgunits should be submitted at the appointed time.</para>
      </listitem>

  <section>
    <title>Data quality checks</title>
    <para>Data quality checking can be done through various means, including:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>At point of data entry, the software can check the data entered to see if it falls within the min-max ranges of that data element (based on all previous data registered).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Defining various validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data entry. The user can also check the entered data for a particular period and Organization Unit(s) against the validation rules, and display the violations for these validation rules. </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Analysis of data sets, i.e. examining gaps in data.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Data triangulation which is comparing the same data or indicator from different sources.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </section>
  <section id="validationRuleAnalysis">
    <title>Running Validation Rule Analysis</title>
    <para>You can access Validation Rule Analysis from the Services-&gt;Data Quality menu.</para>
    <para>A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator  which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criteria are met. For instance, a validation rule could  assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</para>
    <para>The validation rule analysis function will test validation rules against the data
      registered in the system. Validation violations will be reported in cases where the condition
      defined through the validation rule expression is not met, i.e. the condition is false.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Selecting what data to validate:</emphasis> </para>
    <para>First, enter a start date and an end date for which data should be included in the analysis. The date picker widget may be used to select dates. </para>
    <para>Second, choose between including all validation rules or all validation rules from a single group. </para>
    <para>Third, choose between including the selected organisation unit only or the selected organisation unit with all children in the analysis. Fourth, select the organisation unit. Finally, click <emphasis role="italic">validate</emphasis>.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Validation results:</emphasis></para>
    <para>The analysis process will run for a while depending on the amount of data that is being analysed. If there were no violations of the validation rules a message saying <emphasis role="italic">validation passed successfully</emphasis> is displayed. </para>
    <para>If validation violations were found, they will be presented in a list. The organisation unit, period, left side description and value, operator, and right side value and description for each validation violation are displayed. </para>
    <para>The show details icon can be clicked in order to get more information about a validation violation. This will open a popup screen that provides information about the data elements included in the validation rules and their corresponding data values. This information can be used in order to fix incorrect data.</para>
    <para>The validation violations can be exported to a PDF document by clicking on the Download as PDF button, and to a Microsoft Excel workbook by clicking on the Download as Excel button.</para>

    <title>Std Dev Outlier Analysis</title>
    <para>You can access Outlier analysis from the Services-&gt;Data Quality menu.</para>
    <para>The standard deviation based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values
      that are numerically distant from the rest of the data. Outliers can occur by chance, but they
      often indicate a measurement error or a heavy-tailed distribution (leading to very high
      numbers). In the former case one wishes to discard them while in the latter case one should be
      cautious in using tools or interpretations that assume a normal distribution. The analysis is
      based on the standard normal distribution.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Select what data to analyse:</emphasis></para>
    <para>First, select the from and to date for the data to include in the analysis. </para>
    <para>Second, select the data set from which to pick data elements from. </para>
    <para>Third, select all or some of the data elements in the data set by double-clicking or marking them and clicking the add/remove buttons. </para>
    <para>Fourth, select the parent organisation unit to use. All children of the organisation unit will be included. </para>
    <para>Fifth, select the number of standard deviations. This refers to the number of standard
      deviations the data is allowed to deviate from the mean before it is classified as an
      outlier.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Analysis result:</emphasis></para>
    <para>The potential outlier values discovered will be presented in a list after the analysis process is finished. The data element, organisation unit, period, minimum value, actual value, and maximum value will be displayed for each outlier. The minimum and maximum values refer to the border values derived from the number of standard deviations selected for the analysis. </para>
    <para>Each outlier value can be modified directly in the analysis result page. The value can be modified by clicking inside the corresponding field in the value column, entering a value and then navigate away from that field either by clicking tab or anywhere outside the field. The system will provide an alert if the value is still outside the defined minimum and maximum values, but the value will saved in any case. The field will have a red background color if the value is outside the range, and a green if inside. </para>
    <para>Each outlier value can be marked for further follow-up by clicking the star icon.</para>

  <section id="minmaxoutlierAnalysis">
    <title>Min-Max Outlier Analysis</title>
    <para>The min-max value based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are outside the  pre-defined minimum and maximum values. Minimum and maximum values can be custom defined or automatically defined by the system in the data administration module. See the section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="gapAnalysis">
    <title>Gap Analysis</title>
    <para>The gap analysis provides a mechanism for revealing gaps in the data. A gap exists for a specific data element and organisation unit. A gap is a period with  preceding and succeeding periods which have registered data values, but without registered data values itself. Such a gap might indicate a data capture error or omission and could be further investigated.  See the section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="followupAnalysis">
    <title>Follow-Up Analysis</title>
    <para>The follow-up analysis function will list all data values which are marked for follow-up.
      A data value can be marked for follow-up in the data entry module and in the other validation
      analysis variants in this module.</para>
