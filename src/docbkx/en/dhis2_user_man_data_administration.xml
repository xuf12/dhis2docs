  <title>Data Administration</title>
  <para>The data administration module provides a range of functions to ensure that the data stored in the DHIS2 database is integral and that the database performance is optimised. These functions should be executed on a regular basis by a data administrator to ensure that the quality of the data stored is optimal. </para>
  <section id="dataBrowser">
    <title>Data browser</title>
    <para>The data browser maintenance and analysis module which allows the user to produce a summary of the data contained in the DHIS2 database. The summary view provides a count of data elements which have been entered at the selected organisation unit as well as its descendants. Raw data for all data elements for a range of time periods and a given organisational unit can be browsed and exported to Excel, CSV, or PDF formats. There are four modes of the data browser, which determine how the data is summarized</para>

  <section id="dataIntegrity">
    <title>Data integrity</title>
    <para>DHIS2 can perform a wide range of data integrity checks on the data contained in the database. Identifying and correcting data integrity issues is extremely important for ensuring that the data used for analysis purposes is valid. Each of the data integrity checks that are performed by the system will be described, along with general procedures that can be performed to resolve these issues. </para>
    <section>
      <title>Data elements without data set</title>
      <para>Each data element must be assigned to a data set. Values for data elements will not be able to be entered into the system if a data element is not assigned to a data set. Choose Maintenance-&gt;Datasets-&gt;Edit from the main menu and then add the &quot;orphaned&quot; data element to the appropriate data set. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Data elements without groups</title>
      <para>Some Data Elements have been allocated to several Data Element Groups. This is currently not allowed, because it will result in duplication of linked data records in the analytics record sets that provide aggregated data. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data Element Groups to review each Data Element identified and remove the incorrect Group allocations.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Data elements violating exclusive group sets</title>
      <para>
      Some data elements have been allocated to several data element groups that are members of the same data element group set. All group sets in DHIS2 are defined as exclusive, which means that a data element can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> data element group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and indicators -&gt;Data element groups to review each data element identified in the integrity check. Either remove the data element from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Data elements in data set but not in form or sections</title>
      <para>Data elements have been assigned to a data set, but have not been assigned to any sections of the data set forms. All data sets which use section forms, should generally have all data elements in the data set assigned to exactly one section of the dataset. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Data elements assigned to data sets with different period types</title>
      <para>Data elements should not be assigned to two separate data sets whose period types differ. The recommended approach would be to create two separate data elements (for instance a monthly and yearly data element) and assign these to respective datasets. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Data sets not assigned to organisation units</title>
      <para>All data sets should be assigned to at least one organisation unit. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sections with invalid category combinations </title>
      <para>Data sets which use section forms should only have a single category combination within each section. This violation could result from assigning a data element to a section, but then changing the category combination of this data element at a later point in time. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Indicators with identical formulas</title>
      <para>Although this rule will not affect data quality, it generally does not make sense to have two indicators with the exact same definition. Review the identified indicators and their formulas and delete or modify  any indicator that appears to be the duplicate.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Indicators without groups</title>
      <para>All data elements and indicators must be assigned to at least one group, so these Indicators need to be allocated to their correct Data Element and Indicator Group. From the main menu, go to Data elements/Indicators -&gt; Indicator Groups, and allocate each of the `Orphaned` indicators to its correct group.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Invalid indicator numerators</title>
      <para>Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element. Review the indicator and make corrections to the numerator definition. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Invalid indicator denominators</title>
      <para>Violations of this rule may be caused by an incorrect reference to a deleted or modified data element. Review the indicator and make corrections to the denominator definition. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Indicators violating exclusive group sets</title>
      <para>
      Some indicators have been allocated to several indicator groups that are members of the same indicator group set. All group sets in DHIS2 are defined as exclusive, which means that an indicator can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> indicator group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and indicators -&gt;Indicator groups to review each indicator identified in the integrity check. Either remove the indicator from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Duplicate periods</title>
      <para>If periods have been imported from external applications, it may be possible that some periods will be duplicated. If you have any periods which appear to be duplicated here, you will need to resolve these directly in the DHIS2 database. All data which has been assigned to the duplicated period, should be moved to the correct period, and the duplicate period should be removed. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title> Organisation units with cyclic references</title>
      <para>Organisation units cannot be both parent and children of each other, directly nor indirectly. If this situation occurs, you will need to resolve the cyclic reference directly in the DHIS2 datrabase in the &quot;organisationunit&quot; table, by reassigning the &quot;parentid&quot; field of the organisation units. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Orphaned organisation units</title>
      <para>All organisation units must exist within the organisation unit hierarchy. Go to Organisation- units &gt;Hierarchy Operations and move the offending organisation unit into the proper position in the hierarchy. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Organisation units without groups</title>
      <para>All organisation units <emphasis>must</emphasis> be allocated to at least <emphasis>one</emphasis> group. The problem might either be that you have not defined any compulsory OrgUnit Group Set at all, or that there are violations of the compulsory rule for some OrgUnits . NOTE: If you have defined no compulsory OrgUnit Group Sets, then you must first define them by going to Organisation units-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and define at least one compulsory Group Set (the group set &apos;Type&apos; are nearly universally relevant). If you have the relevant group sets, go to Maintenance -&gt; OrgUnit Groups to review each OrgUnit identified and add the relevant Group allocation.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Organisation units violating compulsory group sets</title>
      <para>These organisation units have not been assigned to the any organisation unit group within one of the  <emphasis>compulsory</emphasis> organisation unit group sets. When a group set is defined as compulsory, it means that an organisation unit must be allocated to at least one organisation unit group within that group set. For instance, all organisation units must belong to one of the groups in the &apos;Type&apos; group set. It might belong to  the `Hospital` or the `Clinic` or any other &apos;type&apos; group - but it must belong to exactly one of them.  Go to Organisation units-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Allocate all organisation units to exactly one compulsory group. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Organisation units violating exclusive group sets</title>
      <para>Some organisation units have been allocated to several organisation unit groups that are members of the same organisation unit group set. All group sets in DHIS are defined as exclusive, which means that an organisation unit can <emphasis>only</emphasis> be allocated to <emphasis>one</emphasis> organisation unit group within that Group Set. For instance, one organisation unit cannot normally belong to the both the &apos;Hospital&apos; and &apos;Clinic&apos; groups , but rather to only to one of them. Go to Organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Remove the organisation units from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to.</para>

    <title>SQL View</title>
    <para>The SQL View functionality of DHIS2 will store the SQL view definition internally, and then materialize the view when requested. </para>
    <para>Database administrators must be careful about creating database views directly in the DHIS
      2 database. For instance, when the resource tables are generated, all of them will first be
      dropped and then re-created. If any SQL views depend on these tables, an integrity violation
      exception will be thrown and the process will be aborted.</para>
    <para>The SQL views are dropped in reverse alphabetical order based on their names in DHIS 2,
      and created in regular alphabetical order. This allows you to have dependencies between SQL
      views, given that views only depend on other views which come earlier in the alphabetical
      order. For instance, &quot;ViewB&quot; can safely depend on &quot;ViewA&quot;. Otherwise, having views depending
      on other view result in an integrity violation error.</para>

  <section id="lockException">
    <title>Lock exceptions</title>
    <para>Lock exceptions provide fine-grained control over exemption from a locked data set. After the expiry of the data set, data entry will be denied by default, unless an exception has been granted through the Lock exception interface. To enable a lock exception, select the desired organization units, data sets, and time period and press &quot;Add&quot;. By granting a lock exception, data entry will be enabled even after the expiry period of the data set has passed. </para>

  <section id="cacheStatistics">
    <title>Cache Statistics </title>
    <para>This option is for system administrators only to use. The cache statistics shows the status of the application level cache. The application level cache refers to the objects and query results that the application is caching in order to speed up performance. If the database has been modified directly the application cache needs to be cleared for it to take effect.</para>

  <section id="attribute">
    <title>Attributes</title>
    <para>Dynamic attributes can be used to add additional information to certain objects (namely
      data elements, indicators, organisation units and users). In addition to the standard
      attributes each of these objects have, it may be required in certain installations to have
      additional attributes, such as a fax number which is associated with an organisation unit. To
      add a new dynamic attribute to an object, select &quot;Maintenance-&gt;Data
      administration&quot; from the main menu, then &quot;Attribute&quot; from the left side panel,
      and press the &quot;Add new&quot; button.</para>

    </screenshot>
    <para>To create a new attribute, assign it a name. Each attribute should have a unique name. Check the tick-box &quot;Mandatory&quot; if the object should always have the dynamic attribute. Next, select which object (or objects) the attribute should be assigned to. Lastly, select the value type. You can choose from &quot;Text&quot;, &quot;Yes/No&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Number&quot;, &quot;Integer&quot;, &quot;Positive integer&quot; and &quot;Negative integer&quot;. If the value supplied for the attribute does not match the value type, an error will result. Finally, click &quot;Save&quot; to save the attribute. </para>
    <para>The dynamic attribute will now be present in the object which you assigned it to in the respective &quot;Edit&quot; screen of each the object.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="scheduling">
    <title>Scheduling</title>
    <para>The analytics, resource tables and data mart can be automatically scheduled to run on regular intervals. Simply select the aggregation period types, organisation unit group set aggregation level, and strategy to configure how the scheduled job should run. If you are using surveillance rules, you can choose to run them &quot;All daily&quot; by selecting this option. </para>
    <para>Pressing &quot;Start&quot; will enable the scheduled job to run at a pre-determined time (always at midnight based on the server time). </para>

    <title>Data synchronization</title>
    <para>DHIS 2 provides a feature for synchronizing data being captured on the local instance with
      a another, remote instance of DHIS 2. This can be useful e.g. when you have deployed multiple
      stand-alone instances of DHIS 2 which are required to submit data values to a central DHIS 2
      instance.</para>
    <para>These are the steps to enable data synchronziation:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Go to Settings &gt; Synchronization, enter the remote server URL, username and password
            and click Save. You can test your settings by clicking on the &quot;Test settings&quot;
            link.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Go to Data administration &gt; Scheduling. Under Data synchronization set strategy to
            Enabled, and click Start.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>Some aspects of the data synchronization feature to be aware of:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The local DHIS 2 instance will store the password of the user account on the remote
            instance encrypted in the local database. The remote account is used for authencation
            when transferring data. For security purposes make sure you set the &quot;enryption.password&quot;
            configuration parameter in hibernate.properties to a strong password.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Deploying the remote server on SSL/HTTPS is strongly recommended as the username and
            password are sent in clear text using basic authentication and could be intercepted by
            an attacker.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The data synchronization uses the UID property of data elements, category option
            combos and organisation units to match the meta-data. Hence the synchronization is
            dependent on these three meta-data objects being harmonized on the local and remote
            instance in order to work appropriately.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The very first time DHIS 2 attempts to synchronize data the system will include data
            entered during the last three days. For the subsequent attempts the system will store
            the time of the last successful data synchronization and only include data saved or
            edited since that time. A synchronization job is considered successful only if data was
            submitted, authenticated and saved successfully on the remote server,.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The system will attempt a synchronization every minute. If the local server does not
            have a working Internet connection at the time, the synchronization will be silenly
            aborted and re-attempted after a minute.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>You can see the time of last successful synchronization with remote server in the
            scheduling screen next to the &quot;Last success&quot; label.</para>
