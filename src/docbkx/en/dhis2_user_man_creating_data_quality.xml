    <title>Overview of data quality check</title>
    <para>Ensuring data quality is a key concern in building an effective HMIS. Data quality has different dimensions including:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Correctness:</emphasis> Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that facility. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Completeness:</emphasis> Data for all data elements for all health facilities/blocks/Taluka/districts should have been submitted.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Consistency:</emphasis> Data should be consistent with data entered during earlier months and years while allowing for changes with reorganization, increased work load, etc. and consistent with other similar facilities.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Timeliness:</emphasis> All data from all health facilities/blocks/Taluka/districts should be submitted at the appointed time.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <section>
    <title>Data quality checks</title>
    <para>Data quality checking can be done through various means, including:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>At point of data entry, the software can check the data entered to see if it falls within the min-max ranges of that data element over the last six months or as defined by the user.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Defining various validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data entry. The user can also check the entered data for a particular period and Organization Unit(s) against the validation rules, and display the violations for these validation rules. </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Analysis of data sets, ie. examining gaps in data.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Data triangulation which is comparing the same data or indicator from different sources.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Data quality check at the point of data entry </title>
    <para>Data quality can be checked at the point of data entry through setting the minimum and maximum value range for each element manually or generating the min-max values using the DHIS 2 if there is historical data available for that data element.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Setting the minimum and maximum value range manually </title>
      <para>If you are using the default entry screen click on the element for which you want to set the min-max value. A pop-up window will appear in which you can enter the vaules. On subsequent data entry if the value entered does not fall within the set min-max range the text box will change colour to red. The user will also get a pop-up as shown below. This change in colour is a prompt to check the data entered and make necessary correction. On the data entry screen the users also have the option to add a comment on how the discrepant figure might be explained (if required). This you can do by using the drop down menu of the ‘comment’ box. In case you are using the custom data entry screen which is displayed when you deselect the ‘default data entry form’ option on the top right corner of the screen. In this case the minimum and maximum values can be added by double-clicking on the data entry box instead of the data element.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Generated min-max values </title>
      <para>It is possible to generate the min-max value, element-wise, using the DHIS2. In such case you merely need to click on the ‘Generate min-max’ button near the upper right corner. In case of default data entry screen the min and max values, when generated, will appear on the left and right side of the data entry box. In case you deselect the default data entry form the generated values will appear on the top right end of the screen.</para>

  <section id="validationRule">
    <title>Validation Rule</title>
    <para>This module provides management of validation rules. A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator  which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criterias are met. For instance, a validation rule could  assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</para>
    <para>To add a validation rule, click the add new button. First, provide a descriptive <emphasis
        role="italic">name</emphasis> for the validation rule. The name must be unique among the
      validation rules. Second, provide a description for the validation rule. Third, select an
      operator. The operator options are <emphasis role="italic">equal</emphasis>, <emphasis
        role="italic">not equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">greater than</emphasis>,
        <emphasis role="italic">greater than or equal</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">less
        than</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">less than or equal to</emphasis> and <emphasis
        role="italic">compulsory pair</emphasis>. Then define the left side and right side of the
      validation rule expression. First, provde a description for the expression. Second, build the
      expression with the expression builder. The expression is mathematical and contain data
      elements as well as integers and mathematical operators. Data elements can be included by
      double-clicking one in the available data elements list to the righ. Alternatively one can
      select a data element and click the insert button. Mathematical operators can be included by
      clicking the corresponding button under the expression builder area. Save the expression by
      clicking <emphasis role="italic">save</emphasis>, then save the validation rule by clicking
        <emphasis role="italic">save</emphasis>.</para>
    <para>When defining the expression you can control whether the validation rule should be ignored
      or throw a violation when one or more data elements in the expression have no registered data
      values through the <emphasis role="italic">skip for missing values</emphasis> setting.</para>
    <para>The compulsory pair operator allows you to require that data values must be entered for a
      form for all of the data elements in the expression, or none at all. In other words, you can
      require that if one field in a form is filled, then one or more other fields must also be
      filled.</para>
    <para>To edit a validation rule, click the <emphasis role="italic">edit</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list. Then follow the same producedures as  above.</para>
    <para>To delete a validation rule, click the <emphasis role="italic">delete</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list.</para>
    <para>To view validation rule details, click the <emphasis role="italic">view details</emphasis>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="validationRuleGroup">
    <title>Validation Rule Group</title>
    <para>A validation rule group provides a mechanism for classifying related data elements. Another advantate of using validation rule grops is that it can later be run separately, contrary to running all validation rules.</para>
