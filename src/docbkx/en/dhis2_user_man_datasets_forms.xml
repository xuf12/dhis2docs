  <title>Data sets and data entry forms</title>
  <section id="datasets">
    <title>Data sets</title>
    <para>All data entry in DHIS2 is organised through the use of data sets. You can add and edit
      data sets in Maintenance-&gt;Data sets. A data set is a collection of data elements grouped
      together for data collection and data export between instances of DHIS2 (e.g. from a district
      office local installation to a national server). </para>
    <para>A data set has a data collection frequency which can be set through the period type
      property. The frequency can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, or yearly.
      Which data elements to include in the data set and the frequency are set in the Add/Edit Data
      set window. In order to use a data set to collect data for a specific orgunit you must assign
      the orgunit to the data set, and this mechanism controls which org units that can use which
      data sets. </para>
    <para>Data sets also are assigned to specific organisation units which will be allowed to enter
      data for all data elements in that data set. You can assign org units to a data set in the
      Data set management by clicking on the blue folder icon, the first icon under Operations, next
      to the data set you would like to modify. Alternatively you can manage orgunit assignments for
      all data sets together in the Data set Assignment Editor (available in the right-side menu). </para>
    <para>A data set has several properties that must be entered when creating a new one. Name,
      short name, code and description should be used to identify and describe the data set. The
      other properties deserve an explanation:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Expiry days: Controls for how long it should be possible to enter data in data entry
          for this data set. Expiry days refer to the number of days after the end date of the
          selected data entry period where the data entry form should be open for entry. After the
          number of days has expired, the data set will be locked for further entry. You can set
          manual exceptions to this using the lock exception functionality in data administration
          module.</para>
        <note>
          <para>If the number of expiry days is set to zero, this will  allow data entry into all possible historical time periods. </para>
        </note>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Complete notification recipients: Sets which users should receive a message with a
          notification about this data set being marked as complete in data entry. In this list you
          can select a user group, and all members in this group will receive a notification. The
          message will be delivered through the DHIS messaging system.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Approve data: Define whether data for this data set should be Approved. (See the Data
          approval chapter.)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Skip aggregation: Define whether data for this data set should be skipped during data
          mart generation. You should leave this on no, which is the default behavior, in most
          situations. Can be useful if you have limited server resources and are setting up new
          experimental data sets.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Allow future periods: Defines whether it should be possible to enter data for future
          periods for this data set in data entry. The default behavior is to allow data entry only
          for periods which have passed, i.e. the end date is after today&apos;s date. If set to yes
          you can enter data for future periods, which is useful e.g. for population, target and
          planning data.&apos;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>All fields for data elements required: Defines whether it is mandatory to fill all
          values for a data element in data entry if one or more values have been filled. This means
          that if the user enters one data value for a data element in an entry field (i.e. for a
          category option combination), then she must enter data for all fields belonging to that
          data element (i.e. all category option combinations).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Complete allowed only if validation passes: Controls whether it should be possible to
          mark a data entry form as complete only if the validation of that form is successful.
          Default behavior is yes. If set to no, then a user cannot mark the form complete if
          validation fails.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Skip Offline: Controls whether this data entry form should be downloaded and saved in
          the user&apos;s web browser. Normally you should leave this on no, which is the default
          behavior. If you have forms which are rarely used and are very big you can consider
          setting it to yes to speed up initial loading of the data entry module.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Your data set will then be ready to be used in Services-&gt;Data Entry for the org units
      that you have assigned and for periods according to your selected frequency (period
      type).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Data set categories</title>
      <para>Before reading this section it is recommended to familiarize oneself with the sections
        on categories in the data element chapter. Whereas data element categories can be used for
        capturing disaggregations of data elements, data set categories are used to capture
        information which is common to an entire form.</para>
      <para>To set up categories for data set, start by creating category options, categories and
        category combinations like described in the data element chapter. Make sure that you set the
        type of categories and category combinations to &quot;Attribute&quot;. To assign a category
        combination to a data set, you can select it while creating or updating the data set from
        the &quot;Combination of categories&quot; drop-down box.</para>
      <para>When a data set is linked to a category combination, those categories will be displayed
        as drop-down boxes in the data entry module. Data captured in the form will then be linked
        to the selected category options from those drop-down boxes.</para>
      <para>An scenario for when data set categories are useful is when you need to capture a data
        entry form for a implementer partner organisation and a project. In that case, start by
        creating category options and categories for all partner organisations and projects, before
        linking these in a new category combination. Then, link the category combination to the data
        set (form) for which you need to capture this information. When opening this data set in
        data entry module, the partner organisation and project categories will automatically be
        rendered as drop-down boxes, allowing you to select a specific implementing partner
        organisation and project before continuing to do data entry.</para>

    <title>Data Entry Forms</title>
    <para>Once you have assigned a data set to an orgunit that data set will be made available in
      Data Entry for the orgunits you have assigned it to.  A default data entry form will then be
      shown, which is simply a list of the data elements belonging to the data set together with a
      column for inputting the values. If your data set contains data elements with a non-default
      categorycombination, such as age groups or gender then additional columns will be
      automatically generated in the default form based on the different options/dimensions. </para>
    <para>If you use more than one dataelement category combination you will get multiple columns in the data entry form with different column headings for the options. In addition to the default list-based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the custom form.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Section forms</title>
      <para>Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms and
        are quick and simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables with
        subheadings, and sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table, both of
        these functions are supported in section forms. This function can be access by choosing
        Maintenance-&gt;Data set Section. </para>
    </section>
    <section id="dataSetSection">
      <title>Adding a new section form</title>
      <para>Section forms are separated automatically by data element category combinations, which produce a spreadsheet like data entry form for each section. </para>
      <para>When designing a section form the procedure is as follows:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para> Set up your data set as described in <xref linkend="datasets"/></para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Open the Data Set Section window (from right side menu under Data sets) and add your
            sections one by one. To add a new section to a section form, first choose the data set
            from the &quot;Select data set&quot; combo box. Then choose the specific category combo
            and press &quot;Add new&quot;. You can now add data elements from the &quot;Available
            data element&quot; list on the left to the &quot;Selected data elements&quot; list on
            the right. Data elements can be sorted within the section with the use of the &quot;Move
            up&quot; <inlinegraphic fileref="resources/images/dhis2_images/move_up.png"/> and
            &quot;Move down&quot; <inlinegraphic fileref="resources/images/dhis2_images/move_down.png"/> buttons. Be sure to press
            &quot;Save&quot; once you have finished.<note>
              <para>You can only use one data element category combination per section. </para>
            </note></para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> You may need to control how the data element sections are displayed on the final
            form. In Data set Section management, select the data set from the &quot;Data set&quot;
            drop-down box, then leave [All] in the &quot;Select Category Combo&quot; drop-down.
            Click on &quot;Sort section&quot; to sort the order of appearance of your sections in
            the data entry form.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>In Data Entry you can now start using the Section form (should appear automatically
            when sections are available for the selected data set). Data sets which have section
            forms will automatically display the section form.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Certain data elements may need to be disabled for data entry. Clicking on the  &quot;Section grey field management&quot; menu item will allow you to disable specific data element category options as seen below. Pressing the &quot;Disable&quot; button will prevent data from being entered into this specific data element/category option during data entry. Be sure to press &quot;Done&quot; to save your changes.</para>

      <para>A sample section form is displayed in the next figure. Notice how each data element
        category has been separated into a separate section, and a data entry table has been
        automatically generated by the system. Use of section forms in combination with data element
        categories can drastically reduce the amount of time which is required to create data entry
        forms for data sets.</para>

    <section id="customDataEntryForm">
      <title>Custom Forms</title>
      <para>When the form you want to design is to complicated for the default or section forms then your last option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full flexibility in term of the design. DHIS2 uses a built-in HTML editor (FcK Editor) for the form designer and you can either design the form in the UI or paste in your HTML directly (using the Source window in the editor). A complete reference for use of the editor can be found <ulink url="http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide">here</ulink>.</para>
      <para>One of the big advantages of custom forms, is that they can be created to mimic existing paper aggregation forms. This makes data entry much easier for users, and should reduce the number of data elements which are incorrectly entered, as they are more easily identifiable when entering data from a paper form. </para>
      <para>Once a custom form has been added to a data set it will be available in data entry and
        used automatically. </para>
      <note>
        <para>Custom forms are preferentially displayed over section forms. If a data set has both a
          section form and a custom form, the custom form will be displayed during data entry. Users
          will not be able to select which method they wish to input data, so be sure that your
          custom form contains all data elements which may be required.</para>
      </note>
      <para>To add a custom form design to a data set then first locate your data set in the Data
        set Management window and click on the Design data entry form icon under Operations (the
        fifth icon), see the mouse-over text to be sure.</para>
      <para>First provide a Name for the form. There are a few important buttons in the Editor that you must pay special attention to. The blue monitor icon is the full screen mode on/off button, which can be very useful. The there is a Source button that shows the HTML code for your form. </para>
      <para>If you already have the HTML for your form then you should start by pasting it in here. Click on Source again to go back to preview/non-HTML mode. Then there is an icon in the top right corner with a + sign on it, this will open a list of available data elements to add to your form, the Data Element Selector window. </para>
      <para>All the input fields need to have a link to a data element or indicator. To add new data elements to the form, double-click them from the data element/indicator box as shown below. You can also select a data element/indicator and press the &quot;+Insert&quot; button. You can switch between either data elements or indicators by pressing the respective buttons.</para>

      <title>Scripting in custom forms</title>
      <para>In custom data entry form you can use javascript to create dynamic behavior and
        customziations. The DHIS 2 data entry module provides a range of events which you can
        register for and use to perform actions at certain times. The events are registered on the
        document element. The jQuery event object and the data set identifier are always the first
        two arguments provided to the callback functions. The table below provides an overview of
        the events and when they are triggered.</para>

      <para>To register for such an event:</para>
      <screen>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;

dhis2.util.on( &apos;dhis2.de.event.formReady&apos;, function( event, ds ) {
  console.log( &apos;The form with id: &apos; + ds + &apos; is loaded!&apos; );
} );

dhis2.util.on( &apos;dhis2.de.event.dataValueSaved&apos;, function( event, ds, dv ) {
  console.log( &apos;Data value: &apos; + dv.value + &apos; was saved with data element: &apos; + dv.de );
} );

dhis2.util.on( &apos;dhis2.de.event.completed&apos;, function( event, ds, cr ) {
  console.log( &apos;Form was completed for org unit: &apos; + cr.ou );
} );

&lt;/script&gt;</screen>
      <para>Be careful to only use &quot;namespaced&quot; events like the ones in the example above and not
        general ones like &quot;click&quot; as the dhis2.util.on method will unregister the event
        first.</para>
      <para>If your function only applies to certain data sets you can use the supplied data set
        identifier and shortcut your function for unwanted data sets like this:</para>
      <screen>dhis2.de.on( &apos;dhis2.de.event.validationSuccess&apos;, function( event, ds ) {
  if ( $.inArray( ds, [&apos;utXOiGbEj14&apos;, &apos;Re7qzHEThSC&apos;] ) == -1 ) {
    return false;
  }
  console.log( &apos;Form with id: &apos; + ds + &apos; validated successfully!&apos; );
} );</screen>
      <para>The identifiers of the input fields in the data entry form is on the format described
        below. This format can be used to select the input fields in your script and perform actions
        on them:<screen>&lt;dataelementid&gt;-&lt;optioncomboid&gt;-val</screen></para>
      <para>Since the data set identifier is provided for all events a feasible alternative is to
        utilize the &quot;files&quot; Web API resource and keep your callback functions in a single file,
        where you let the javascript code take action based on which data set is currently
        loaded.</para>

      <title>Data set assignment editor</title>
      <para>The data set assignment editor is a tool for adding and removing many data sets to organisation units in batch style. Start by selecting an organisation unit from the selection tree. In the area below the tree a grid will be displayed showing all data sets as columns and the child organisation units as rows.</para>
      <para>From the grid you can now assign or unassign data sets simply by clicking on of the corresponding icons in the grid. If you want to assign or unassign an organisation unit to all data sets you can check or uncheck the checkbox next to the organisation unit. Your changes will automatically be saved.</para>
