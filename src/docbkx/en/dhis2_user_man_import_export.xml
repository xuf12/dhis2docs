  <title>Import and export</title>
  <para>In a primary health system, the HMIS typically involves a distributed application, where the
    same application is running in different geographical locations (PHCs,CHCs, hospitals,
    districts, and state). Most of these physical locations do not have Internet connectivity, and
    hence they work off-line. At some point (normally at the district level), the data needs to be
    synchronised in order to have a consolidated database for the a particular geographical region.
    For this, it is important to be able to export data from one location (which is working offline,
    say at the health facility level) to another one say at the district level where the data would
    need to be imported. This feature of exporting and importing is thus a crucial function of a
    HMIS. This feature also helps us overcome the dependency on Internet to some degree, as data
    updates can be transferred via USB key where there is no connectivity, or through email where
    there is limited Internet connectivity. DHIS 2 provides robust export-import functionality to
    fulfill these needs. </para>

      <para>Meta-data objects can be easily imported by accessing Import-Export-&gt;Meta-Data import. Select the file to import  by pressing &quot;Select&quot; and choose the file from your local file system. When importing XML and JSON files, the system will automatically detect which type of objects which should be imported. When importing CSV metadata, you will need to specify the object type. Consult the corresponding section in this manual on &quot;CSV Metadata import&quot; for more specific information on how the CSV file should be created.  </para>

          <para>Strategy: There are three options here, &quot;New and Updates&quot;, &quot;New only&quot;, and &quot;Update
            only&quot;. New and updates tells the importer to expect both new meta-data, and updates to
            existing ones. New only will only accept fresh meta-data, usually you would use this on a
            empty database. Updates only will only allow the meta-data to match meta-data that is
            already there (same identifiers, new name etc).</para>

        <title>Dry run before importing</title>
        <para>Before doing the import into your database, it is highly recommended that you run the
          import with the dry run option set to true first. This will enabled you to have a look at
          how many new, updates, and ignored meta-data there will be. After you have selected your
          file, set dry run to true, you can now click the import button. After doing this, you will
          be greeted by this window.</para>

        </mediaobject>
        <para>Here you can see that the organisation unit &quot;Nduvuibu MCHP&quot; had a unknown reference to
          an object with ID &quot;aaaU6Kr7Gtpidn&quot;, which means that an object with this ID was not
          present in your imported file, and it could not be found in the existing database. Its
          important to note that even if a reference could not be found, the object will still be
          imported, but you might have to fix this directly in DHIS2 later, if the reference should
          have pointed to something else.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Matching identifiers in DXF2</title>
        <para>The DXF2 format currently support matching for two identifiers, the internal DHIS2 identifier (known as a UID), and also using an  external identifier called called a &quot;code&quot;. When the importer is trying to search for
        references (like the one above), it will first go to the UID field, and then to the code
        field. This allows you to import from legacy systems without having a UID for every meta-data
        object. I.e. if you are importing facility data from a legacy system, you can leave out the
        ID field completely (DHIS 2 will fill this in for you) and the put the legacy systems own
        identifiers in the code field, this identifier is required to be unique. This not only works
        for organisation units, but for all kinds of meta-data, allowing for easy import from other
        systems.</para>

        the left side menu. You must select the object type which your CSV file contains. You can
        only upload one type of objects at the time. Upload your file and click update. For the CSV
        format, please visit the Web API chapter > CSV meta-data import in the developer
        guide.</para>

      <title>GML data import</title>
      <para>The GML import function can be used to import data prepared in the Geography Markup Language (GML). GML can be used to update the coordinates (both polygons and points). Once you have prepared your GML file as detailed in the chapter on &quot;Importing coordinates&quot;, you can load the file with this function. </para>
      <para>It is currently not possible to import an organisation unit hierarchy with GML.
        Therefore, you should create the organisation unit hierarchy separately, and then use GML to
        update the coordinates once the hierarchy has been created. </para>
      <note>
        <para>Currently, it is only possible to import GML data by matching on the name of the
          organisation unit itself. Therefore, if you have organisation units with the same name in
          your organisation unit hierarchy (e.g. two clinics with exactly the same name), you will
          need to distinguish them before importing GML. Otherwise, both organisation units may be
          updated with the same set of coordinates. </para>

    <title>Importing data</title>
    <para>The import option allows different instance of DHIS 2 to receive standardised sets of data in the absence of a networked system. The functionality can also be used to import data produced by another system (perhaps on a regular basis) or to import legacy data which has been transformed into a format which DHIS2 can understand. Typically, a data set is exported from one DHIS2 instance (e.g. a district level system) to another system (e.g. a provincial level system).  DHIS 2 is also capable of importing data directly from a DHIS 1.4 Access database. Each of these options will be discussed in the following sections. </para>

      <para>There are two ways to import data from a DHIS 1.4 database; 1) through the 1.4 XML-based export files, or 2) directly from the DHIS 1.4 data file (.mdb). Both are accessible from the DHIS 1.4 Import menu under Import in the Import-Export module.</para>
      <para>It is critical that all data integrity violations which are present in the DHIS 1.4
        database be fully resolved before attempting an import into DHIS2. You can check the data

    <title>Exporting data and meta-data</title>
    <para>DHIS2 makes it possible to export various types of data in multiple data formats. You can
      export your data, also referred to as measures or facts; and your meta-data, which refers to
      the information describing your data. Data can be exported both in raw, non-aggregated format
      and in aggregated format. It is also possible to export a combination of data and meta-data in
      case you have special requirements. This chapter covers mainly how to export data and
      meta-data through the user interface of the import-export DHIS 2 module. Data can also be
      exported programmatically through the DHIS 2 Web API, and it is useful to be aware of the
      various options available:</para>

    <para>Data can be exported on various formats, including DXF 2 (the DHIS 2 meta-data and data
      exchange format based on XML), CSV, PDF, MS Excel and the DHIS 1.4 XML format. </para>
    <para>Another aspect of data export is the type of DHIS 2 deployment. In the case of online
      deployment, all data is saved into a single database only. In an offline deployment, each
      instance will store data in a separate database in their local system. In an offline
      deployment, after the data entry is finished, data will have to be manually sent to the next
      level in the organizational hierarchy. In an on-line application this is not required, as all
      data is captured over an Internet connection and stored in a central location.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Metadata export</title>
      <para>Meta-data is &quot;data about data&quot;. In the context of DHIS 2, meta-data consists
          of definitions of data elements, indicators, the structure and names contained in the
          organizational hierarchy, and other options. Click on the &quot;Meta-data export&quot; link
          from the main &quot;Data export&quot; screen in order to access this. Just select the
          features, format, and the compression that you want and click &quot;Export&quot;. This
          metadata file can then be transmitted just like a data file, except it will contain
          information on the definitions of the various features, as opposed to the values of the
          data themselves. </para>
