  <title>Sharing</title>
  <para>This chapter discusses the sharing of entities feature in DHIS 2.</para>
  <section>
    <title>Sharing of objects</title>
    <para>A large part of the objects in DHIS 2, like reports, charts, maps and indicators, can be
      shared. Sharing means making an object, like a report, available for reading or modification
      to a group of users or to everyone. For instance for reports, the sharing dialog can be opened
      by clicking on the "Sharing settings" button next to each report in the list.</para>

    <para>You can share your report with everyone or with a number of user groups. Next to "Public
      access" you can choose your public access option: "None", "Can view" or "Can edit and view".
      Edit also implies deleting the report. To share with a group, simply start typing the name of
      the group and the "Search for user groups" input field and select your desired group. Click on
      the "+" icon next to the input field to share with that group. For each group you can set an
      access option, similar to public access.</para>
    <para>Sharing with a user group implies that all users in that group will get access to the
      shared object. To create a user group you can go to the dashboard module and click on "Groups"
      on the front page. This will lead you to the list of groups where you can click "Add new" in
      the top right corner. Creating user groups is open for everyone from the dashboard
      module.</para>

    <title>Sharing and access control</title>
    <para>The objects which support sharing are indicator, indicator group, indicator group set,
      data dictionary, data set, program, standard report, resource, report table, chart, map and
      user group. Out of those objects, report table, chart, map and user group are open for
      everyone to create privately. Private means that the objects are available only to yourself or
      potentially to a number of user groups if you choose to share the object. These objects are
      referred to as "open" objects and can be created by all users. The reminaing objects require
      that your user account has the authority to create them. These objects are referred to as
      "non-open" objects.</para>
    <para>A user can be granted the authority to create publicly accessible objects or privately
      accessible objects. In order to create a publicly accessible object (available for viewing or
      editing by anyone) your user account must have the authority to do so. As an example, to
      create a publicly accessible chart, your user must have the "Create public chart" authority
      granted. The authority to create private objects applies only to non-open objects. For
      example, to allow a user to create indicators which will only be accessible to that user and
      not to everyone, the user can be issued with the "Create private indicator" authority.</para>
    <para>Sharing a non-open object with another person and let her edit the object requires that
      the person's user account has the authority for updating that type of objects granted. For
      instance, if you want to let another person edit your indicator, that person's user account
      must have the "Update indicator" authority granted. This does not apply for open
      objects.</para>
    <para>When you create a new object it will automatically become viewable for everyone if your
      user account has the authority to create public objects. As an example, if you create a
      standard report and you have the "Create public standard report" authority granted, the report
      will become viewable for everyone. If you do not have that authority granted the report will
      be viewable only to yourself. After you have created an object, you may navigate to the
      "Sharing settings" dialog and set your desired access control level.</para>
    <para>If you need a user account which is able to view absolutely all objects you can create a
      user role with the "ALL" authority and assign a user to that role. If you need to switch
      between a "complete" view of objects and a "personal" view of objects it is recommended to
      create two user accounts, one assigned with the "ALL" authority and one without.</para>

    <title>Sharing applied</title>
    <para>The sharing functionality is useful in several scenarios. One use-case is setting up a
      DHIS instance for a global organisation with operations in multiple countries. Typically the
      organisation has a set of global data sets, indicators and reports which should apply to all
      countries, while all countries will have the need for country-specific data sets, indicators
      and reports. In this scenario the following approach could work: </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Set up one user group for global personell.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Set up a user group for personell in each country.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Create global data sets and reports, make them viewable for everyone and editable for
          the global user group only.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Create country-specific data sets and reports, make them viewable and editable for the
          country user group and the global user group only.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>This way, the global indicators and reports could be viewed and analysed by everyone, but
      maintained by the global user group only. The country-specific data sets, indicators and
      reports could be viewed and maintained by the country and global personell, without being
      visible or impacting the system for other countries in the organisation.</para>
    <para>A similar approach could work for a scenario with a donor, multiple funding agencies and
      implementing partners in a country, where user groups could be set up for each of those
      entities. That way each implementing partners could create and share their reports internally
      within their organisation without affecting or allowing access to others. Reports could also
      be shared with supervisors and funding agencies at the end of reporting periods.</para>
    <para>Another use-case is a country department of health with multiple health programs.
      Typically there is a need for having general reports and charts for the department while
      allowing the health programs to develop specific reports and charts for internal use. This can
      be achieved by creating user groups for each health program. Later, when developing reports
      and charts, these can be made viewable and editable to the program user group only. This way
      the reports will not be visible to other programs and users. This is benecifial because the
      reports are kept internal to the program and because the visible list of reports of other
      users are kept shorter and more relevant.</para>
