  <title>User management</title>
  <para>DHIS2 allows for multiple users to access the system simultaneously, each with a define set of permissions. These permissions can be finely tuned so that certain users can only enter data, while others may generate reports. Multiple user roles can be created, each with their own set of permissions, and then assigned to users which grant them certain privileges within the system. This chapter describes how to manage users and user roles.</para>

    <title>Creating new users and roles</title>
    <para>This section will describe how to add new users and manage existing users to the DHIS2 application. You can create as many user names as you need. Each user can be assigned certain privileges, and can be assigned to certain organisation units for which they will be enabled to enter data on behalf of. To access the user module, choose &quot;Maintenance-&gt;Users&quot; from the main menu.</para>

      <title>User role management</title>
      <para>As part of creating a user name you are required to define the user
      role. Do so by clicking on the ‘user role’ appearing on the left side of
      the displayed screen. This will lead you to the Role Management page where you will have
      to click on <guibutton>Add new</guibutton> to create a new role.</para>

      <para>The following screen will open and here in the first text box you
      need to give Name of the Role such as Super User, Admin User, etc. The
      second text box called ‘Description’ gives more information about the
      type of User Role that is being created for e.g. State Admin User,

      <para>Next you will specify the particular data set(s) that are to be
      made available to the particular role. You will also need to specify the
      type of ‘authority’ to be given to the particular user. For each of the
      three options namely Datasets, Reports and Authorities user can select
      multiple options from the scroll down menu provided against each field.
      A user can choose multiple options either by moving them
      one-by-one.</para>
      <para>In order for particular users to be able to enter data, you must
      add them to both a dataset as well as an organisational unit level. You
      can also select multiple datasets individually by pressing the Ctrl key
      on the keyboard and clicking on individual datasets.</para>
      <para>Finally when you have entered the required fields click on
      <guibutton>Save</guibutton> which is located on the lower part of the
      displayed screen. The desired user role and related authorisation will
      be saved to the database, and can then be assigned to a particular
      user.</para>

          <para>Users must be assigned to at least one data capture organisation unit. Users will
            have access to all children of the organisational units which have been assigned to
            them. For instance, if a user has been assigned to a district which has several
            facilities contained in the district, the user would have access to the district's data,
            as well as all of the facilities contained within the district. The data approval org
            units control for which org units the user can do data entry.</para>

          <para>Users can be assigned to any number of data view organisation units. This controls
            which org units the user can view aggregated data for in analysis modules. Giving access
            to an org unit implicitly gives access to all org unit below it in the org unit
            hierarchy.</para>
          <para>In order for users to be able to enter data for specific organisational units, they
            must be assigned these units. If a user is responsible for entering data for all
            facilities for a given district, they should typically be assigned the district, and all
            of the facilities contained within the district.</para>
